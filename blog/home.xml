        I've finally gotten around to cobbling together a templating engine for a blog.
        Right now there are still some major pieces missing, including a document index, a real home page, and most importantly something worth reading.
        Lately I've been working on a variety of FPGA demos built on top of <html:a href="https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen">nMigen</html:a>.
        This work is publicly available in my <html:a href="https://github.com/sjolsen/nmigen-nexys">nmigen-nexys repository</html:a>.
        Once I get the rest of the backend for this site working, I'll probably write some articles about my experience with this.
