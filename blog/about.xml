    <title>About me</title>
    <body>
      <html:p>
        I'm a graduate of Texas State University and formerly a senior software engineer at Google.
        My professional experience is primarily in firmware development and testing, hardware bring-up, system design, and custom software development infrastructure.
        I have varying levels of experience in several fields, some closely related to my professional work and some less so, including electrical engineering, computer architecture, programming language theory, category theory, control theory, operating systems, and FPGA development.
