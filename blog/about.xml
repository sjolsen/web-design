    <title>About me</title>
    <body>
      <html:p>
        I'm a graduate of Texas State University and a current senior software
        engineer at Google (any views expressed here are my own, etc. etc.). My
        professional experience is primarily in firmware development and
        testing, hardware bring-up, system design, and custom software
        development infrastructure. I have varying levels of experience in
        several fields, some closely related to my professional work and some
        less so, including electrical engineering, computer architecture,
        programming language theory, category theory, control theory, operating
        systems, and FPGA development.

        Some of my old work is hosted on my GitHub page (<html:a
        href="https://github.com/sjolsen">https://github.com/sjolsen</html:a>),
        but little if any of it is likely to be of practical use.

        I may start a blog here if I ever get around to learning web development
        beyond the static hand-written HTML and CSS you see here.
