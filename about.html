          <h2 class="section">About me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a graduate of Texas State University and a current senior
            software engineer at Google (any views expressed here are my own,
            etc. etc.). My professional experience is primarily in firmware
            development and testing, hardware bring-up, system design, and
            custom software development infrastructure. I have varying levels of
            experience in several fields, some closely related to my
            professional work and some less so, including electrical
            engineering, computer architecture, programming language theory,
            category theory, control theory, operating systems, and FPGA
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hobbies include cross-stitch, music (mainly clarinet), and
            rarely, programming. Some of my old work is hosted on my GitHub page
            (<a href="https://github.com/sjolsen">https://github.com/sjolsen</a>),
            but little if any of it is likely to be of practical use.
          </p>
          <p>
            I may start a blog here if I ever get around to learning web
            development beyond the static hand-written HTML and CSS you see
            here.
          </p>
